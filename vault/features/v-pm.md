# v-pm

## Scope
Cross-project feature planning + async agent coordination. `/v-pm` drafts a project-agnostic plan into a
shared `_features/<feature>/` workspace; per-project `/v-team <feature>` sessions read it and coordinate
through file-based conversation threads instead of the human relaying context. Non-goals: execution
(that stays with `/v-team` / `/v-work`); a live agent-to-agent channel (coordination is file-based, async).

## Contracts
- **Command**: `/v-pm <necessity>` (plan) · `/v-pm reconcile <feature>` · `/v-pm status`. Dispatcher
  `commands/v-pm.md` + steps `01-intake` · `02-plan-panel` · `03-seed-workspace` · `04-reconcile` ·
  `05-status`.
- **Workspace** `~/vault/_features/<feature>/`: `header.md` · `generic-plan.md` (only v-pm writes) ·
  structured `contracts.md` · `conversation/` · `projects/<proj>/plan.md`. No `ledger.md` (derived).
- **Thread protocol**: filename encodes state — `THREAD_<n>_OPEN_→<proj|pm>.md` →
  `…_ANSWERED_<answerer>.md` → `…_RESOLVED.md`; frontmatter `from`/`to`/`asks`.
- **v-team seam**: `commands/v-team/steps/00-feature-pickup.md` (feature-gated Step 0) — auto-pickup +
  deterministic contracts-drift check. Templates under `templates/_features/`. Docs: `vault-guide.md` §13.

## Behaviors & rules
- 1 resolved participant → hand off to `/v-team`, no workspace seeded (break-even gate).
- Ledger is derived from thread filenames on read → no writer, no multi-session race.
- Thread `→pm` (generic-plan / contract change) is drained only by `/v-pm reconcile`.
- Step 0 contracts-drift check is deterministic (field-by-field vs structured `contracts.md`); LLM
  phrases rationale only.
- Unknown `<feature>` slug → warn loudly, continue as a plain `/v-team` run.
- Reply latency = next open of the asking project's session, or `/v-pm status`; no live channel.

## Coupling
- Inherits the PROPOSE clarify + research front gates from `/v-work` §3a (ADR-012).
- Planning panel borrows finding-schema + synthesize from `/v-team` `03-propose-loop` (not
  `_shared/critic-panel.md`). Execution runs through `/v-team` Step 0. `_features/` wired into `/v-sync`.

## Gotchas
- `_features/` is a separate committed vault, not under any project — it holds the source-of-truth plan +
  contracts and must be versioned + synced independently (never lives next to the local-only `_global/`).
- `contracts.md` must stay structured (tables / typed blocks) or the deterministic drift check degrades.
- Auto-pickup is pull-only; `/v-pm status` is the required push surface so threads don't orphan.
